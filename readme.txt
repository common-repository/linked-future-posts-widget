A widget that displays a list of scheduled posts with links to the posts.

== Description ==

Linked Future Posts Widget acts very much like the upcoming posts widget by displaying
scheduled posts instead of published ones, but includes a link to each post (using slug/post name).  Requires WordPress 2.8+

Use this plugin in conjunction with the Future plugin from Marion Sudvarg to create a Post Grid of scheduled events and a list of scheduled 
events on the post page.  Events that change from scheduled to published status will automatically be removed from the grid and list.

Linked Future Posts Widget is a derivative of the Upcoming Posts Widget plugin created by Aaron D. Campbell.
